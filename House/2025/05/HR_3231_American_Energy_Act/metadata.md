Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as providing authority to a Federal court to vacate a lease. .\n##### (b) Term of permit To drill\nSection 17 of the Mineral Leasing Act ( 30 U.S.C. 226 ) is further amended by adding at the end the following:\n(r) Term of permit To drill A permit to drill issued under this section after the date of the enactment of this subsection shall be valid for one four-year term from the date that the permit is approved, or until the lease regarding which the permit is issued expires, whichever occurs first. .\n#### 3.
